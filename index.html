    <p>Farm websites need to be both personable and professional. How does a designer accomplish both?</p>

    <h2>Design Principles</h2>
    <img src="images/line-2.png">
    <p>No matter what type of site you are designing for,
      good design principles need to be in place. Websites
      are investments a business is making, and it needs to
       be designed with that in mind. Farm websites
       specifically tend to stray from design principles.
       While you will want your small farm to come across
       as personable, using these design principles will help
       the farm you are designing for to also come across as a
       professional business. Keep these design principles in mind when
       designing your farm website to help it come across
       as more professional and user friendly:
     </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Clear and easy to find navigation.</b>
        Farm sites are often so cluttered it can be hard to
        find the navigation. Using things like larger and
        bolder typefaces, space, and simple wording can help
        your navigation stand out.</li>
      <li><b>Language that targets the audience.</b>
        Small farms often target local audiences that are
        specific to their area. Make sure you know who your
         site is addressing. Don’t use language they won’t
         understand, and since you are often addressing a
         more local audience, it is okay to use language
         that is more friendly and approachable. When doing
          this, make sure it does not come across as
          unprofessional as your audience won’t take you
          seriously.</li>
      <li><b>Clear calls to action.</b> What do you want
        your audience to do with the information you are
        presenting? It is good to keep in mind the purpose
        of the site when you are designing it. Since farms
        often do not sell their own products, the call to
        action will often be to be informed of what the
        farm specializes in such as organic products, or
        to go to one of the local markets to buy their
        products.</li>
      <li><b>Good use of white space.</b> One of the biggest problems with most farm websites is they are too cluttered. Text and pictures are thrown at the user and they don’t know where to look. White space needs to be used to help the user know where to look and comprehend the information. </li>
      <li><b>Good use of hierarchy.</b> Hierarchy and white space go hand in hand. Because farm websites often have cluttered information, having hierarchy will help make it seem less cluttered. Have clear separations between headings and body text. You can use larger text or different colors to help headings stand out. Make the hierarchy clear so your user can easily navigate all the information you are giving them.</li>
      <li><b>Make your site mobile friendly.</b> Most farm websites are not user friendly, and it is good to know that ALL sites should be mobile friendly. You might not think of it, but there is a good chance a large portion of your audience will be accessing your site on their phones. Having a mobile version of your site will help the farm come across as both professional and accommodating to their audience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Principles for Small Farms</h2>
    <img src="images/line-2.png">
    <p>Good design and a sense of professionalism is needed when designing a site for any business. Farms specifically need help in this area. Farms tend to come across as much more friendly than the average business. They are usually family owned and their customers are often people they know personally. If you are familiar with any small farm website, you would know they are not the most professionally designed site out there. Farms tend to be more personable than professional, and we as designers need to find a balance. While this needs to be done with any small business, if you are designing a site for a small farm, here are some things to keep in mind specifically for this type of business:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>What the farm specializes in needs to be front and center.</b> This is often what sells products for farms. Do they use a new kind of technology? Are they considerate of the environment? This is what you should be continually calling attention to. Make it front and center on your home page, use things like fonts and color to call attention to it. Repeat it on your other pages and use it as an anchor for the rest of your design. Do they specialize in grass-fed? Use that to choose a color scheme and help draw your design to that point.</li>
      <li><b>Basic design principles need to be used so the farm you are designing for comes across as trustworthy.</b> One of the biggest problems with small farm websites is they try to be too personable, and come across as untrustworthy. If you do not apply the basic design principles talked about earlier, your audience will loose trust and your farm will look unprofessional. </li>
      <li><b>Quality visuals need to be used to show the product you are selling.</b> This is very important for farms as you are selling food. If you have low quality images of your product, customers aren’t going to want to buy it. Most farms do not take the time to have high quality images of their product. Spend the time and money to have a professional come and take pictures of your product. This can go a long way in helping the farm come across as trustworthy and caring. Considering the visuals of your website is also a good opportunity to give it personality and balance your farm’s professional and personable feel. High quality photographs can help your farm feel professional, but also having warm and inviting subject matter can help your farm feel inviting. You can also use imagery like icons or quality hand drawn elements to help make the farm seem more personable.</li>
      <li><b>Typefaces should not look too “friendly” or unprofessional.</b> This is where a lot of farm websites loose their business feel. If you do a search of small farm websites you will see a mix of comic sans and display fonts. Using typefaces like this will make your farm loose credibility. The best way to accomplish the balance between professional and personable is to spend time choosing your typefaces. Fonts will completely set the mood for your site, and you want to choose them wisely. Make sure your typeface is readable. You can add more personality in headings.</li>
      <li><b>Make sure the audience knows what they are buying, and where to buy it.</b> Farms can be unique in that they most likely will not sell their own product. Because of this, make sure it is clear where your customers can buy the products. You can put this information at the bottom of each page, or give it a page all on its own. Be clear how they can contact the farm and the steps they need to take in order to buy your products.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section social-media">
    <h2>The Role of Social Media</h2>
    <img src="images/line-2.png">
    <p>Social Media plays a big role for any business. Social media still needs to be present, but not in place of a website. You will find many small farms use social media in place of having a website, and even sell their products off of facebook. This is not a proper way to present information to clients, especially when you want to come across as professional. You should make sure the farm you are designing for understands the need for a website and also knows the importance of social media.
      While these are good principles to note for any small business, make sure the farm you are designing for understands them, as small farms most often do not do this well:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Social media should advertise their products.</b> It should NOT be a place they sell their products, but is a tool to promote what they sell. Farms can use it to show pricing, promote new products, and showcase what is special about what they sell (organic, grass-fed, etc.)</li>
      <li><b>Use social media to connect with your customers.</b> For any business, social media is a great place to show your customers you are available and want to serve them. </li>
      <li><b>Their social media should point to their website.</b> Do not post every piece of information you have on your website. It should be a place to highlight information and ultimately point them to the website which shows who you are as a business.</li>
    </ul>
